## 📌 Overview

Plant diseases significantly reduce agricultural productivity and threaten food security. Early and accurate detection of plant diseases helps improve crop yield and reduces excessive pesticide usage.

**Plant AI** is a deep learning–based system that detects plant diseases from leaf images using computer vision and convolutional neural networks. The application classifies plant leaves into healthy or diseased categories and displays the results through a web interface.
